#. Give it a title. We will use the first letter of title to sort it into our glossary navigation (if activated).

#. Enter a description which will be shown on configured detail page

#. At tab `Categories` you can relate club entry to a category. That way you can show only club records of
   a defined category in plugin, if you want.
